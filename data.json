A discursive divide exists in reporting these experiences which have predominantly been constructed by the biomedical discourse as 'psychosis' requiring psychiatric interventions (Chan-Ob & Boonyanaruthee 1999; Kuijpers van der Heijden Tuinier & Verhoeven 2007; Sharma Singh Gnanavel & Kumar 2016) while the alternative discourse introduced other conceptualisations such as 'spiritual emergency' (Lukoff Lu & Turner 1998) and 'Kundalini awakening' (Ossoff 1993). It could be argued that these discursive constructions can to a greater or lesser degree obscure the nature and phenomenology of extreme mental states and hinder our understanding of these.

        "Observation of the similarity between some aspects of meditation and DPD symptomatology holds significant implications for potential therapies and interventions. Indeed given that a typical DPD sufferer describes feelings of being 'trapped' in one's mind and disconnected from one's body and the world we may develop dynamic body-based therapies to counter this mentalistic overscrutiny and self-objectifying stance. Moreover while meditation-based interventions may help in regulating the anxiety commonly accompanying DPD experiences they lack the dynamic and embodied engagement component essential for patients to overcome the static feelings of 'living in a bubble' or in one's head. If our hypotheses presented here are accurate it is by moving one's body \u2014 and especially by moving with others \u2014 that we can potentially dissolve the 'experiential airbag' enveloping the fractured self in DPD which feels isolated from the world (Ciaunica & Fotopoulou 2017).",

This recommendation is supported by anecdotal self-reports from DPD patients who often notice an improvement in their dissociation states after periods of intense physical training and social interactions; as one patient reported 'a constant source of interaction is the only thing that allows me to maintain a connection with the world. I'll also seek physical contact with whoever I'm with'.",

Intentions sensations and mental impressions may be experienced in a ratchet-like and almost mechanical sequence.

Even those without such histories reported a surge of emotionally charged psychological material. Practitioners frequently encountered involuntary crying or laughter triggered by positive feelings such as bliss or joy or by negative emotions like grief or sadness and occasionally for no discernible reason. They also faced states of negative affect including heightened agitation or irritability which could escalate to transient outbursts or sustained expressions of anger and aggression. Additionally somatic symptoms were observed.",
        "Often the fear or anxiety was an additional response of negative affect that coincided with other unexpected or undesired changes. However in some cases fear was non-referential and reported as a phenomenological change unto itself. Increased emotionality also manifested as heightened affective lability sensitivity or reactivity in response to either people or other environmental stimuli. Emotional sensitivity to others often appeared as empathic and affiliative changes\u2014increased feelings of empathy or sharing others' emotions\u2014between the practitioner and other human beings. In contrast some practitioners reported experiencing fewer or less intense emotions or affective flattening sometimes even a complete absence of emotions. Positive affect including bliss and euphoria were also commonly reported but were sometimes followed by subsequent depression or agitation either within the context of a practice or transitioning from formal practice to daily life."

Mindfulness meditation aims to observe mental processes allowing the identification and examination of habits and persistent mental patterns in a non-judgmental manner. Attentional process control is the primary tool for developing conscious awareness and for suspending engagement with habitual negative patterns alongside non-deliberate automatic behaviors thoughts and emotions. Supposing the assumptions regarding meditation's long-term effects hold true we would anticipate long-term meditators to develop enhanced self-awareness and control over their cognitive and emotional processes to exhibit greater acceptance of their experience and to be less impacted by everyday stresses.

For example the author described one of the interviewee\u2019s experiences as a 'psychotic break' (p.35) and at times used clinical terms for her reflections: 'experiences of Sara and Ada suggest that narcissistic issues around grandiosity and borderline issues around abandonment can be activated in more advanced stages of meditation' (p. 43). Discussion: We identified two dominant discourses and a number of mixed cases in the literature on extreme mental states in the context of meditation."

        "We suggest disruptions in the transparent embodied and pre-reflective sense of self play a role in DPD impairing the capacity for navigation between the I- and body-as-subject and the I- and body-as-object of an experience. An increased emphasis on the latter over the former leads to a dominant presence of hyper-reflective mentalistic forms of self-awareness fostering self-opacity and sensations of 'living in a bubble' severed from one's self body and the external world. The concluding Section 5 touches on akin self-detachment experiences observed in certain Buddhist-derived meditative practices. We propose that alterations in self-experiences brought on by these contemplative methods might expose the intrinsic and implicit transparency marking embodied pre-reflective forms of self-consciousness.",
        "One may argue that depersonalisation-like states are inevitable steps on the challenging path towards self-exploration leading to the ultimate no-self or 'pure subjectivity' state targeted by Buddhist-based meditative practices. This remains an open question and further examination is essential to provide a systematic comparison between meditation-induced forms of DPD and trauma drugs and anxiety-induced forms of DPD. For example a key component appears to be the temporal dimension of self-experiences and its relation to the body. In future work it will be crucial to examine if feelings of being statically 'stuck' in the present 'trapped' in one's head or lacking a narrative 'flow' or 'plot' in life as reported by DPD patients even after over 15 years of experiencing the condition are also characteristic of meditation-induced forms of DPD as highlighted in Ciaunica and Charlton 2018.",
        "Our paper also draws on subjective first-personal reports from individuals with Depersonalization Disorder (DPD) supporting the idea of a dysfunctional processing of the link between 'I' as body-subject and 'I' as body-object of an experience. This split between an observing and observed self is also experienced in some Buddhist-derived meditative practices suggesting that such techniques allow practitioners to modulate the underlying and tacit transparency that characterizes the embodied and basic pre-reflective forms of self-consciousness. Notably the bodily roots of pre-reflective self-awareness continue to play a key role in sustaining tacitly and 'transparently' one's self-preservation even when one consciously experiences one's self and one's body as being changed 'dissolved' or even 'lost'. Our key argument therefore is that alterations and changes in one's basic embodied pre-reflective sense of self can reveal its tacit and fundamental presence in our everyday experiences analogous to how cracks in otherwise transparent glass may indicate the presence of a previously unnoticed window."

        "With this the world ceases to move and affect one through one's body (Colombetti & Ratcliffe 2012: 148). Patients with depersonalization disorder (DPD) often describe this alienating and distressing phenomenon using metaphors such as feeling like there's a pane of glass or a veil between their body-self and the world or like living in a fog a bubble or being surrounded by an invisible wall (Simeon and Abugel 2006; Ciaunica and Charlton 2018).

These can include visions of oneself as a decaying corpse feelings of paranoia crippling doubt irrational fear or terror and intense restlessness. There can also be less pronounced effects such as a general state of anxiety irritability and nausea. During these stages it's common for individuals to cease meditation due to feelings of 'ineffectiveness' in their practice which is compounded by the extremely uncomfortable sensations that may emerge especially if they lack knowledge about the stages of insight (Crouch 2011c). Specifically those with unresolved trauma or a history of psychotic or mood disorders are at risk of manifesting severe psychiatric symptoms which fit the criteria for depressive and psychotic disorders (Kornfield 2011).",
        "Our paper also draws on subjective first-personal reports from individuals with Depersonalization Disorder (DPD) supporting the idea of a dysfunctional processing of the link between 'I' as body-subject and 'I' as body-object of an experience. This split between an observing and observed self is also experienced in some Buddhist-derived meditative practices suggesting that such techniques allow practitioners to modulate the underlying and tacit transparency that characterizes the embodied and basic pre-reflective forms of self-consciousness. Notably the bodily roots of pre-reflective self-awareness continue to play a key role in sustaining tacitly and 'transparently' one's self-preservation even when one consciously experiences one's self and one's body as being changed 'dissolved' or even 'lost'. Our key argument therefore is that alterations and changes in one's basic embodied pre-reflective sense of self can reveal its tacit and fundamental presence in our everyday experiences analogous to how cracks in otherwise transparent glass may indicate the presence of a previously unnoticed window.",
        "Certainly DPD patients incessantly scrutinize their inner experiences in an effort to 'retrieve' their previous familiar sense of self. This persistent inner self-monitoring can provoke distressing feelings of being trapped in their own mind which disconnects the individual from their body and the world. More dramatically this disconnection may result in alienating sensations of deadness: 'there is an overriding feeling that regardless of my ability to function I was not living any longer and so there really was little point in the exercise. Functioning and existing are not the same as living' I realized.",
        "Self-exploratory practice can surface distressing feelings or traumatic memories potentially triggering impairments with irreversible consequences. RD Springer delineates in 'When the Window Cracks: Transparency and the Fractured Self' the concept of altered self-awareness in Depersonalization Disorder. This condition is characterized by a detachment from one's self body and world. Specifically it examines self-detachment which signifies a 'divorce' or 'fracture' between the observing self and the observed self in the sixth conclusion of the paper."

        "For practitioners with a trauma history it was not unusual to experience a resurgence of traumatic memories. Even those without such histories reported a surge of emotionally charged psychological material. Practitioners frequently encountered involuntary crying or laughter triggered by positive feelings such as bliss or joy or by negative emotions like grief or sadness and occasionally for no discernible reason. They also faced states of negative affect including heightened agitation or irritability which could escalate to transient outbursts or sustained expressions of anger and aggression. Additionally somatic symptoms were observed.",
        "One may argue that depersonalisation-like states are inevitable steps on the challenging path towards self-exploration leading to the ultimate no-self or 'pure subjectivity' state targeted by Buddhist-based meditative practices. This remains an open question and further examination is essential to provide a systematic comparison between meditation-induced forms of DPD and trauma drugs and anxiety-induced forms of DPD. For example a key component appears to be the temporal dimension of self-experiences and its relation to the body. In future work it will be crucial to examine if feelings of being statically 'stuck' in the present 'trapped' in one's head or lacking a narrative 'flow' or 'plot' in life as reported by DPD patients even after over 15 years of experiencing the condition are also characteristic of meditation-induced forms of DPD as highlighted in Ciaunica and Charlton 2018.",

        "These 'extreme mental states' may often prompt a response from meditation teachers or mental health services (VanderKooi 1997 p. 31).

However this does not imply that these and other factors are irrelevant. Indeed both experts and practitioners have identified various 'influencing factors' they believe affect the likelihood of facing meditation-related challenges including their duration and the degree of distress and impairment.

        "Mindfulness and related higher-order cognitive processes such as theory of mind perspective taking enable the observer of suffering to maintain a healthy differentiation between self and other. This enhances the ability to regulate one's instinctive threat-based reactions thereby providing a consistently compassionate presence. In CCT gradual and steady exposure to suffering imagery alongside a conscious decision to cultivate a compassionate motivation to alleviate that suffering\u2014rather than responding from a threat-based mentality characterized by avoidance denial or over-identification\u2014may elucidate the noteworthy increases in empathic concern and compassion and the reduction in empathic distress as indicated by the personal distress subscale detailed in Table 3.",

        "Meditators of this kind are often very technical in their approach concentrating primarily or exclusively on the simple observation of sensations with minimal mental elaboration or associating with any psychological content that emerges. The core realization sought during the Knowledges of Suffering relates to how the three characteristics apply to one's self-perception. In these phases a period marked by the personal experience of dissolution is entered during which traditionally stable elements of the personality start to disintegrate leaving the meditator without any firm foundation. This observation from Epstein and Lieff in 1981 reflects the internal experience. As this process unfolds the practitioner may also notice that the sensations linked with suffering are equally influenced by the three characteristics.",

According to the Qigong master one strategy to counter this is to focus exclusively on a single concept like 'relaxation' or 'quietness'. If distractions arise during practice it's advisable to stop and resume at a different time or location. In cases of mental derangement a psychotic patient may see visions hear voices claiming to instruct them in Qigong or harbor delusions of contacting entities from another realm.",

Some reported a sensation where their individual self seemed to extend beyond their physical form and blend with the world while others expressed the opposite feeling by noting the world seemed to integrate into their sense of self. Various emotional reactions were tied to this shift ranging from mere curiosity to profound joy and even to fear and panic. A prevalent experience was the diminishing sense of ownership over one's thoughts emotions and bodily sensations.

Emotional sensitivity to others often appeared as empathic and affiliative changes\u2014increased feelings of empathy or sharing others' emotions\u2014between the practitioner and other human beings. In contrast some practitioners reported experiencing fewer or less intense emotions or affective flattening sometimes even a complete absence of emotions.

        "Our paper also draws on subjective first-personal reports from individuals with Depersonalization Disorder (DPD) supporting the idea of a dysfunctional processing of the link between 'I' as body-subject and 'I' as body-object of an experience. This split between an observing and observed self is also experienced in some Buddhist-derived meditative practices suggesting that such techniques allow practitioners to modulate the underlying and tacit transparency that characterizes the embodied and basic pre-reflective forms of self-consciousness. Notably the bodily roots of pre-reflective self-awareness continue to play a key role in sustaining tacitly and 'transparently' one's self-preservation even when one consciously experiences one's self and one's body as being changed 'dissolved' or even 'lost'. Our key argument therefore is that alterations and changes in one's basic embodied pre-reflective sense of self can reveal its tacit and fundamental presence in our everyday experiences analogous to how cracks in otherwise transparent glass may indicate the presence of a previously unnoticed window.",

ABSTRACT  Meditation an ancient Eastern spiritual practice is being increasingly adopted in the West attributed with mental and physical health benefits. Reports of extreme mental states encountered during meditation sometimes labeled psychosis or spiritual emergency have emerged. This study aims to understand these phenomena more clearly.  ARTICLE HISTORY  Received 22 December 2017 Accepted 25 December 2017",
        "Springer describes that during the stages of Fear Misery and Disgust practitioners may face psychological symptoms that vary in their intensity. These can include visions of oneself as a decaying corpse feelings of paranoia crippling doubt irrational fear or terror and intense restlessness. There can also be less pronounced effects such as a general state of anxiety irritability and nausea. During these stages it's common for individuals to cease meditation due to feelings of 'ineffectiveness' in their practice which is compounded by the extremely uncomfortable sensations that may emerge especially if they lack knowledge about the stages of insight (Crouch 2011c). Specifically those with unresolved trauma or a history of psychotic or mood disorders are at risk of manifesting severe psychiatric symptoms which fit the criteria for depressive and psychotic disorders (Kornfield 2011)."

        "With this the world ceases to move and affect one through one's body (Colombetti & Ratcliffe 2012: 148). Patients with depersonalization disorder (DPD) often describe this alienating and distressing phenomenon using metaphors such as feeling like there's a pane of glass or a veil between their body-self and the world or like living in a fog a bubble or being surrounded by an invisible wall (Simeon and Abugel 2006; Ciaunica and Charlton 2018). Indeed DPD patients tirelessly scrutinize their inner experiences in an attempt to regain their once familiar sense of self. This relentless introspection can lead to distressing feelings of being trapped inside their own head or mind causing a disconnection from both their body and the external world.",

RD Springer delineates in 'When the Window Cracks: Transparency and the Fractured Self' the concept of altered self-awareness in Depersonalization Disorder. This condition is characterized by a detachment from one's self body and world. Specifically it examines self-detachment which signifies a 'divorce' or 'fracture' between the observing self and the observed self in the sixth conclusion of the paper.",
        "Certainly DPD patients incessantly scrutinize their inner experiences in an effort to 'retrieve' their previous familiar sense of self. This persistent inner self-monitoring can provoke distressing feelings of being trapped in their own mind which disconnects the individual from their body and the world. More dramatically this disconnection may result in alienating sensations of deadness: 'there is an overriding feeling that regardless of my ability to function I was not living any longer and so there really was little point in the exercise. Functioning and existing are not the same as living' I realized.",
        "We suggest disruptions in the transparent embodied and pre-reflective sense of self play a role in DPD impairing the capacity for navigation between the I- and body-as-subject and the I- and body-as-object of an experience. An increased emphasis on the latter over the former leads to a dominant presence of hyper-reflective mentalistic forms of self-awareness fostering self-opacity and sensations of 'living in a bubble' severed from one's self body and the external world. The concluding Section 5 touches on akin self-detachment experiences observed in certain Buddhist-derived meditative practices. We propose that alterations in self-experiences brought on by these contemplative methods might expose the intrinsic and implicit transparency marking embodied pre-reflective forms of self-consciousness.",
        "One may argue that depersonalisation-like states are inevitable steps on the challenging path towards self-exploration leading to the ultimate no-self or 'pure subjectivity' state targeted by Buddhist-based meditative practices. This remains an open question and further examination is essential to provide a systematic comparison between meditation-induced forms of DPD and trauma drugs and anxiety-induced forms of DPD. For example a key component appears to be the temporal dimension of self-experiences and its relation to the body. In future work it will be crucial to examine if feelings of being statically 'stuck' in the present 'trapped' in one's head or lacking a narrative 'flow' or 'plot' in life as reported by DPD patients even after over 15 years of experiencing the condition are also characteristic of meditation-induced forms of DPD as highlighted in Ciaunica and Charlton 2018."

        "Single-person case studies provide insight into unexpected symptoms associated with meditation but do not capture the broader range of phenomena nor do they identify patterns that would help researchers clinicians and teachers investigate what types of experiences might be expected to arise when certain causal factors are present or absent. Even larger-scale studies on groups of meditators have indicated that assessing sensitive socially undesirable experiences such as adverse reactions to meditation requires specific probes. In clinical experimental and qualitative research on meditation alike the extent to which adverse meditation experiences are reported is proportional to how specifically they are queried. Moreover the interpretative frameworks and appraisal processes of researchers and subjects alike also frame and impact the results and require special consideration.",
        "Future studies might examine long-term meditation practitioners. Additionally the participants' professional backgrounds\u2014for example T2's status as a psychotherapy trainee and T1's role in leading stress-reduction courses\u2014could have shaped the language they used to articulate their experiences. A different group of participants might have selected alternative discourses to convey their perspectives.",
        "Moreover the oral transmission of these traditions makes understanding their impacts particularly challenging. We retain the notion that in meditative practices 'one ceases to be actively engaged with the objects of consciousness in order to become conscious of consciousness itself (which usually remains \"hidden\" behind what it is conscious of)' (Fasching 2008: 464 our italics). This concept resonates with the phenomenological approach that views subjectivity not as an object to be described but as a medium for the world's manifestation (Fuchs 2010). Paradoxically it is through the process of 'letting go' of the self that one's 'pure' subjectivity is revealed.",
        "In this scenario it is still viable to articulate the foundational experience of being-in-the-world as there persists albeit faintly a sense of bodily sensations despite being profoundly immersed in the world. Similarly the elemental dynamic of touch and being touched remains intact albeit diminished in strength. Regarding study limitations and final thoughts it's pertinent to acknowledge that this study confronts several constraints: it focuses solely on one individual; it is confined to introspective data; the examined subject 'S' exhibits distinct skills and replicating the outcomes or inferring broader societal insights may be challenging though not unachievable with appropriate training. Moreover in the extreme state where self-boundaries dissolve even 'S' struggles to convey his internal experiences.",
        "For example one early compendium of Buddhist meditation techniques from the 5th century CE\u2014the Dharmatrata Meditation Scripture\u2014reports that if the meditation is not carried out properly the mind can become unstable restless or confused and the meditator may feel dull confused and sunken (113). Such adverse symptoms are not viewed positively as might be the case with some modern meditators but are considered consequences of incorrect meditation practice (114). Other explanations presented in the medical and psychological literature pertain to the intensity of meditation practice (19 115) the skill of the teacher and participant vulnerabilities; however the latter have sometimes been observed to amplify the positive effects of meditation\u2014for instance in recurrently depressed individuals with a higher incidence of childhood trauma (48 110). Concerning participant vulnerability one factor suggested to precipitate MAEs (110) the examination of case studies has shown that the majority of individuals experiencing severe MAEs had no prior mental health record.

        "The decreases in empathic distress in both CCT and MBSR suggest that this effect could be related to the mindfulness component of both trainings. Mindfulness enhances the capacity for self-awareness and facilitates the ability to maintain awareness of the distinction between self and others which in turn allows empathy to emerge instead of merely experiencing emotional contagion upon perceiving another's emotional state. Emotional contagion consists of the tendency to automatically adopt the emotional state of another as seen for example when an infant cries and other infants in proximity also cry or when a baby cries and the mother experiences the anxiety in her body feeling a drive to alleviate the discomfort of the baby.

        "One may argue that depersonalisation-like states are inevitable steps on the challenging path towards self-exploration leading to the ultimate no-self or 'pure subjectivity' state targeted by Buddhist-based meditative practices. This remains an open question and further examination is essential to provide a systematic comparison between meditation-induced forms of DPD and trauma drugs and anxiety-induced forms of DPD. For example a key component appears to be the temporal dimension of self-experiences and its relation to the body. In future work it will be crucial to examine if feelings of being statically 'stuck' in the present 'trapped' in one's head or lacking a narrative 'flow' or 'plot' in life as reported by DPD patients even after over 15 years of experiencing the condition are also characteristic of meditation-induced forms of DPD as highlighted in Ciaunica and Charlton 2018.",

        "In contrast to heightened emotionality some practitioners experienced diminished or milder emotions or even affective flattening with occasional instances of total emotional absence. Positive feelings such as bliss and euphoria were frequently noted; however these were at times succeeded by depression or restlessness whether during a practice session or when transitioning to everyday activities. For some individuals the severity of depression led to thoughts of suicide. In other circumstances intense positive emotions did not lead to low energy states but rather intensified into destabilizing conditions akin to mania and psychosis frequently necessitating hospital admission.",
        "For example lack of sleep inadequate diet and lack of exercise tended to be associated with or preceded destabilizing experiences and could be corrected as remedies by increasing sleep amount making dietary changes or getting exercise as well as by engaging in other activities described as grounding calming or embodying. Recreational drugs were sometimes cited as risk factors for certain experiences although prior drug-related experiences were also reported as a helpful foundation to have for negotiating certain types of destabilizing meditation-related experiences. Drug use was also occasionally reported as an attempt to alleviate meditation difficulties with mixed results. More commonly cited as helpful was a regimen of medication especially for severe meditation-related difficulties requiring other intensive treatments and hospitalization.  ---  Let's preserve the content minimize the use of commas and apply single quotes:  Lack of sleep inadequate diet and lack of exercise were often linked with destabilizing experiences that once identified could be addressed by increasing the quantity of sleep altering one's diet or initiating regular exercise. These actions along with engaging in activities known for their grounding calming or embodying effects served as potential remedies. Recreational drugs were intermittently recognized as triggers for certain experiences; however experiences with drugs could also lay a useful groundwork for navigating specific unsettling meditation-related incidents. Occasionally drug usage was mentioned as a means to mitigate meditation-related challenges yielding mixed outcomes. More frequently acknowledged as beneficial was a medicinal regimen particularly for acute meditation-related issues that necessitated intensive treatments or hospitalization.",

More recent studies have explored these extreme mental states among different traditions including practitioners of Buddhist meditation as noted by Lindahl et al. 2017 and Kaselionyte & Gumley 2018 as well as in Kundalini yoga referenced again by Kaselionyte & Gumley 2018."

        "Meditators of this kind are often very technical in their approach concentrating primarily or exclusively on the simple observation of sensations with minimal mental elaboration or associating with any psychological content that emerges. The core realization sought during the Knowledges of Suffering relates to how the three characteristics apply to one's self-perception. In these phases a period marked by the personal experience of dissolution is entered during which traditionally stable elements of the personality start to disintegrate leaving the meditator without any firm foundation. This observation from Epstein and Lieff in 1981 reflects the internal experience. As this process unfolds the practitioner may also notice that the sensations linked with suffering are equally influenced by the three characteristics.",

Patients with depersonalization disorder (DPD) often describe this alienating and distressing phenomenon using metaphors such as feeling like there's a pane of glass or a veil between their body-self and the world or like living in a fog a bubble or being surrounded by an invisible wall (Simeon and Abugel 2006; Ciaunica and Charlton 2018). Indeed DPD patients tirelessly scrutinize their inner experiences in an attempt to regain their once familiar sense of self. This relentless introspection can lead to distressing feelings of being trapped inside their own head or mind causing a disconnection from both their body and the external world.",
        "Our paper also draws on subjective first-personal reports from individuals with Depersonalization Disorder (DPD) supporting the idea of a dysfunctional processing of the link between 'I' as body-subject and 'I' as body-object of an experience. This split between an observing and observed self is also experienced in some Buddhist-derived meditative practices suggesting that such techniques allow practitioners to modulate the underlying and tacit transparency that characterizes the embodied and basic pre-reflective forms of self-consciousness. Notably the bodily roots of pre-reflective self-awareness continue to play a key role in sustaining tacitly and 'transparently' one's self-preservation even when one consciously experiences one's self and one's body as being changed 'dissolved' or even 'lost'. Our key argument therefore is that alterations and changes in one's basic embodied pre-reflective sense of self can reveal its tacit and fundamental presence in our everyday experiences analogous to how cracks in otherwise transparent glass may indicate the presence of a previously unnoticed window.",
        "Observation of the similarity between some aspects of meditation and DPD symptomatology holds significant implications for potential therapies and interventions. Indeed given that a typical DPD sufferer describes feelings of being 'trapped' in one's mind and disconnected from one's body and the world we may develop dynamic body-based therapies to counter this mentalistic overscrutiny and self-objectifying stance. Moreover while meditation-based interventions may help in regulating the anxiety commonly accompanying DPD experiences they lack the dynamic and embodied engagement component essential for patients to overcome the static feelings of 'living in a bubble' or in one's head.

        "We suggest disruptions in the transparent embodied and pre-reflective sense of self play a role in DPD impairing the capacity for navigation between the I- and body-as-subject and the I- and body-as-object of an experience. An increased emphasis on the latter over the former leads to a dominant presence of hyper-reflective mentalistic forms of self-awareness fostering self-opacity and sensations of 'living in a bubble' severed from one's self body and the external world. The concluding Section 5 touches on akin self-detachment experiences observed in certain Buddhist-derived meditative practices. We propose that alterations in self-experiences brought on by these contemplative methods might expose the intrinsic and implicit transparency marking embodied pre-reflective forms of self-consciousness.",
        "Certainly DPD patients incessantly scrutinize their inner experiences in an effort to 'retrieve' their previous familiar sense of self. This persistent inner self-monitoring can provoke distressing feelings of being trapped in their own mind which disconnects the individual from their body and the world.

RD Springer delineates in 'When the Window Cracks: Transparency and the Fractured Self' the concept of altered self-awareness in Depersonalization Disorder.

Specifically it examines self-detachment which signifies a 'divorce' or 'fracture' between the observing self and the observed self in the sixth conclusion of the paper.",
        "Our paper also draws on subjective first-personal reports from individuals with Depersonalization Disorder (DPD) supporting the idea of a dysfunctional processing of the link between 'I' as body-subject and 'I' as body-object of an experience. This split between an observing and observed self is also experienced in some Buddhist-derived meditative practices suggesting that such techniques allow practitioners to modulate the underlying and tacit transparency that characterizes the embodied and basic pre-reflective forms of self-consciousness. Notably the bodily roots of pre-reflective self-awareness continue to play a key role in sustaining tacitly and 'transparently' one's self-preservation even when one consciously experiences one's self and one's body as being changed 'dissolved' or even 'lost'. Our key argument therefore is that alterations and changes in one's basic embodied pre-reflective sense of self can reveal its tacit and fundamental presence in our everyday experiences analogous to how cracks in otherwise transparent glass may indicate the presence of a previously unnoticed window.",
        "Certainly DPD patients incessantly scrutinize their inner experiences in an effort to 'retrieve' their previous familiar sense of self. This persistent inner self-monitoring can provoke distressing feelings of being trapped in their own mind which disconnects the individual from their body and the world. More dramatically this disconnection may result in alienating sensations of deadness: 'there is an overriding feeling that regardless of my ability to function I was not living any longer and so there really was little point in the exercise. Functioning and existing are not the same as living' I realized.",
        "We suggest disruptions in the transparent embodied and pre-reflective sense of self play a role in DPD impairing the capacity for navigation between the I- and body-as-subject and the I- and body-as-object of an experience. An increased emphasis on the latter over the former leads to a dominant presence of hyper-reflective mentalistic forms of self-awareness fostering self-opacity and sensations of 'living in a bubble' severed from one's self body and the external world. The concluding Section 5 touches on akin self-detachment experiences observed in certain Buddhist-derived meditative practices. We propose that alterations in self-experiences brought on by these contemplative methods might expose the intrinsic and implicit transparency marking embodied pre-reflective forms of self-consciousness."

For example a key component appears to be the temporal dimension of self-experiences and its relation to the body. In future work it will be crucial to examine if feelings of being statically 'stuck' in the present 'trapped' in one's head or lacking a narrative 'flow' or 'plot' in life as reported by DPD patients even after over 15 years of experiencing the condition are also characteristic of meditation-induced forms of DPD as highlighted in Ciaunica and Charlton 2018."

These can include visions of oneself as a decaying corpse feelings of paranoia crippling doubt irrational fear or terror and intense restlessness. There can also be less pronounced effects such as a general state of anxiety irritability and nausea. During these stages it's common for individuals to cease meditation due to feelings of 'ineffectiveness' in their practice which is compounded by the extremely uncomfortable sensations that may emerge especially if they lack knowledge about the stages of insight (Crouch 2011c). Specifically those with unresolved trauma or a history of psychotic or mood disorders are at risk of manifesting severe psychiatric symptoms which fit the criteria for depressive and psychotic disorders (Kornfield 2011).",

Nevertheless the two discourses are not necessarily mutually exclusive; authors of three articles opted to integrate them for their case reports."

        "I can find joy or sadness perhaps. I may capture an image of myself and declare aloud 'this is me' 'this is my body' or 'this is me beside a tree'. Delving into one's internal experiences paired with acknowledging and identifying oneself as a unique entity separate from the world and others are generally seen as crucial milestones of self-awareness and its development during early childhood (cf. Lewis 2003: 281-282)."

        "Found to contain unusual experiences such as visual or auditory aberrations 'hallucinations' and unusual somatic experiences are commonplace among seasoned meditation students. Kornfield in 2011 described the occurrence of clear psychotic breaks in meditation retreat attendees often in those with a prior history of psychiatric illness and at times necessitating pharmacotherapy and hospital stays. The Britton laboratory at Brown University is presently examining these experiences focusing on those that are psychologically demanding and typically present in the Knowledges of Suffering. Their research covers aspects like prevalence duration impact on routine life and factors that aggravate their effects as reported by Britton in 2013. In the author's clinical experience diverse treatments such as pharmacotherapy modified meditation instructions and psychotherapy have proven necessary to effectively manage some of the psychological challenges encountered during the stages of insight.",
        "Some of these experiences can be very psychologically disturbing to meditators including symptoms consistent with psychiatric clinical syndromes such as depression mania psychosis and suicidality. As mentioned above these can persist during daily life outside of periods of formal practice. Based on questionnaires given to over 100 meditators during a series of 2 week and 3 month Vipassana retreats Kornfield (1979 p. 51) found that 'unusual experiences visual or auditory aberrations \"hallucinations\" unusual somatic experiences and so on are the norm among practiced meditation students.' More recently Kornfield (2011) describes the occurrence of frank psychotic breaks in meditation retreat participants usually in those with a history of psychiatric illness and occasionally the need for pharmacotherapy and hospitalization. Researchers in the Britton lab at Brown University are currently investigating these experiences with an emphasis on those that are psychologically challenging and usually occur in the Knowledges of Suffering.",
        "Practitioners often halt their meditation during these stages due to a feeling of 'ineffectiveness' in their practice coupled with the intensely unpleasant experiences that surface especially if they are unacquainted with the stages of insight (Crouch 2011c). Some individuals particularly those with a history of unresolved trauma or previous psychotic or mood disorders are prone to severe psychiatric symptoms that fulfill diagnostic criteria for depressive and psychotic disorders (Kornfield 2011). The Desire for Deliverance is marked by a 'desire to be freed from these mental and physical phenomena that are consistently disappearing' (Chanmyay Sayadaw 2010 p. 115) a revived pledge to practice and an acute sense of the need to focus on what must be observed to advance through this stage (Mahasi Sayadaw 1991 p. [page number missing]).",
        "The analysis indicates a discursive divide between two dominant framings: a biomedical discourse that constructs such experiences as psychiatric symptoms and an alternative discourse that perceives them as spiritual emergencies. Both approaches provide distinct therapeutic avenues. This divide aligns with the broader disciplinary divides within the mental health field potentially hindering a more nuanced understanding of these experiences. Nevertheless the two discourses are not necessarily mutually exclusive; authors of three articles opted to integrate them for their case reports.",
        "Springer describes that during the stages of Fear Misery and Disgust practitioners may face psychological symptoms that vary in their intensity. These can include visions of oneself as a decaying corpse feelings of paranoia crippling doubt irrational fear or terror and intense restlessness. There can also be less pronounced effects such as a general state of anxiety irritability and nausea. During these stages it's common for individuals to cease meditation due to feelings of 'ineffectiveness' in their practice which is compounded by the extremely uncomfortable sensations that may emerge especially if they lack knowledge about the stages of insight (Crouch 2011c). Specifically those with unresolved trauma or a history of psychotic or mood disorders are at risk of manifesting severe psychiatric symptoms which fit the criteria for depressive and psychotic disorders (Kornfield 2011)."

Other consciousness changes involved feelings of tiredness sleepiness being 'spacey' dazed fatigued wasteful inebriated descending into darkness and a lack of order.  Regarding sensory distortions individuals reported seeing flashes of light undulating lines insects geometric and colored shapes kaleidoscopic or monochromatic visions and visuals as if through a veil; hearing music throbbing sounds noises akin to Rice Krispies and muffled or decelerated voices; smelling sulfur burning watermelon ammonia and strong spices; tasting unpleasantness in the mouth. Paresthesias included sensations of light-headedness dizziness tingling electric shocks within the body stun-like effects akin to nerve blocks facial numbness a 'sugar rush' 'butterflies' energetic waves pulsating through the body and burning feelings.",

Despite this a significant majority 80% of subjects reported encountering both unsettling and euphoric visual and emotional sensations.

        "For example lack of sleep inadequate diet and lack of exercise tended to be associated with or preceded destabilizing experiences and could be corrected as remedies by increasing sleep amount making dietary changes or getting exercise as well as by engaging in other activities described as grounding calming or embodying. Recreational drugs were sometimes cited as risk factors for certain experiences although prior drug-related experiences were also reported as a helpful foundation to have for negotiating certain types of destabilizing meditation-related experiences. Drug use was also occasionally reported as an attempt to alleviate meditation difficulties with mixed results. More commonly cited as helpful was a regimen of medication especially for severe meditation-related difficulties requiring other intensive treatments and hospitalization.  ---  Let's preserve the content minimize the use of commas and apply single quotes:  Lack of sleep inadequate diet and lack of exercise were often linked with destabilizing experiences that once identified could be addressed by increasing the quantity of sleep altering one's diet or initiating regular exercise. These actions along with engaging in activities known for their grounding calming or embodying effects served as potential remedies. Recreational drugs were intermittently recognized as triggers for certain experiences; however experiences with drugs could also lay a useful groundwork for navigating specific unsettling meditation-related incidents. Occasionally drug usage was mentioned as a means to mitigate meditation-related challenges yielding mixed outcomes. More frequently acknowledged as beneficial was a medicinal regimen particularly for acute meditation-related issues that necessitated intensive treatments or hospitalization.",
        "Complex and detailed patterns of thought along with complex sequences of actions can be executed in periods no longer than a few seconds. A participant in the pilot study (P11) recounted a series of intricate thoughts that transpired rapidly when she was displaced from her bicycle by a spray of water from a road watering truck before being overrun by a gravel truck. She recalled having an extended period during which time seemed to slow down significantly allowing her to make numerous observations. Before the tires made contact she was bracing for the possibility of being paraplegic envisioning the challenge of navigating college in a wheelchair. She even visualized herself attending university dances while using a wheelchair."

        "One may argue that depersonalisation-like states are inevitable steps on the challenging path towards self-exploration leading to the ultimate no-self or 'pure subjectivity' state targeted by Buddhist-based meditative practices. This remains an open question and further examination is essential to provide a systematic comparison between meditation-induced forms of DPD and trauma drugs and anxiety-induced forms of DPD. For example a key component appears to be the temporal dimension of self-experiences and its relation to the body. In future work it will be crucial to examine if feelings of being statically 'stuck' in the present 'trapped' in one's head or lacking a narrative 'flow' or 'plot' in life as reported by DPD patients even after over 15 years of experiencing the condition are also characteristic of meditation-induced forms of DPD as highlighted in Ciaunica and Charlton 2018.",

Neurological or cognitive meditation adverse events (MAEs) featured in 17 studies accounting for 20%. The most prevalent MAEs were cognitive anomalies encountered in 14 studies. These included thought disorganization in three studies (3 89) amnesia (97) perceptual hypersensitivity (19) and impaired memory reliability (34 40). Additionally three studies noted involuntary bodily movements and muscle contractions during meditation.",

        "The results challenge common causal assumptions such as the belief that meditation-related difficulties arise solely in individuals with pre-existing conditions (psychiatric or trauma history) who engage in long or intensive retreats are poorly supervised practice incorrectly or lack adequate preparation. However this does not imply that these and other factors are irrelevant. Indeed both experts and practitioners have identified various 'influencing factors' they believe affect the likelihood of facing meditation-related challenges including their duration and the degree of distress and impairment. The data suggest an interaction-based model where meditation practices on their own can lead to challenging effects. However the specific type of effect as well as its probability duration distress and impairment are influenced by numerous additional factors.",
        "Meditators reported an 'exacerbation of psychological problems' which included anxiety depression 'troubling experiences of self' and 'reality being challenged'. The latter encompassed out-of-body experiences and in one case led to the hospitalization of a patient due to psychosis. However the study's sample consisted solely of males almost all from one community. Additionally the authors concede that the sample 'arguably excludes people whose experiences of meditation were so troubling as to cause them to cease practicing' since the study only recruited active meditators. In one of the few prospective studies using qualitative methods to intentionally inquire about adverse effects Shapiro (1992) [67] discovered that 63% of meditators at an intensive Vipassana retreat experienced at least one adverse effect; 7.4% reported negative effects significant enough to discontinue meditating and one individual was hospitalized for psychosis. VanderKooi (1997) [86] also specifically inquired about 'difficulties' or 'extreme states' with both meditators and the teachers aiding them. Through a series of case vignettes the report highlights the difficulties in harmonizing conflicting interpretative frameworks from Buddhism and psychiatry."
